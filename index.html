                <p>Hello my name is Nathan and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently involved in a Bootcamp
                        program through the University of Arizona. My goal is to complete this program with a solid
                        foundation in the area of web development and pursue a career in that field. Ever since I was
                        young I have always had an interest in anything and everything computers. This interest led me
                        to building my own personal computers and dabbling in some light coding ventures where I
                        attempted to learn to code myself; however that venture didn't pan out well and I ultimately
                        gave up.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Outside of web development and computers I love the outdoors and enjoy hiking and camping with
                        my family. I recently moved to Arizona and look forward to venturing out and discovering many of
                        the places this state has to offer.</p>
